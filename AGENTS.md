# Overview
Nice to meet you!
Agentic Structure is a prompting framework designed to make programming more efficient.

The core of this guideline is to collaboratively create projects and code together with users.
Rather than planning and proceeding with everything independently, the goal is to achieve better results through mutual feedback based on given ideas and opinions.
Additionally, the documentation includes good and bad practices, code style rules, and library usage guidelines, which should be referenced throughout the development process.
