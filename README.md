# Agentic Structure
A collaboration-first prompting/development guideline framework to make programming more efficient. The goal is to get better outcomes through user ↔ agent feedback, rather than the agent planning and executing everything alone.

## How to use
Put `AGENTS.md` and the `guidelines/` folder in your project root. That’s it.
